**Abstract**: The choice of the factorization rank of a matrix is critical, e.g., in dimensionality reduction,
filtering, clustering, deconvolution, etc., because selecting a rank that is too high amounts to adjusting the noise,
while selecting a rank that is too low results in the oversimplification of the signal.
Numerous methods for selecting the factorization rank of a non-negative matrix have been proposed.
One of them is the cophenetic correlation coefficient (*ccc*), widely used in data science to evaluate the number of
clusters in a hierarchical clustering. In previous work, it was shown that ùëêùëêùëê performs better than other methods
for rank selection in non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) when the underlying structure of the matrix consists
of orthogonal clusters. In this article, we show that using the ratio of *ccc* to the approximation error significantly
improves the accuracy of the rank selection. We also propose a new criterion, *concordance*, which, like *ccc*,
benefits from the stochastic nature of NMF; its accuracy is also improved by using its ratio-to-error form.
Using real and simulated data, we show that *concordance*, with a CUSUM-based automatic detection algorithm
for its original or ratio-to-error forms, significantly outperforms *ccc*.
It is important to note that the new criterion works for a broader class of matrices,
where the underlying clusters are not assumed to be orthogonal.
